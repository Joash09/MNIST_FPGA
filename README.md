# MNIST_FPGA

Joash Naidoo

A tutorial project to try implement a very basic neural network which classifies the MNIST data set on a Kintex7 FPGA. The project relies on a model being built and trained using Keras (Tensorflow backend) and FPGA code generation and synthesis done by HLS4ML. 

TODO:

* Compile model to FPGA
* Write up a testbench for Vivado simulation
